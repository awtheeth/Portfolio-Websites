							<h3>Introduction To Technology</h3>
							<p>Technology plays a significant role in every human being's life. It is being used in daily purpose activities as well as for huge tasks that normal humans cannot perform. Although, it has already grabbed the attention of the various huge organization and people. The technology can work for further more advanced features and ideas. Everyone has their perspective toward technology.  Technology is about taking action to meet a human need rather than merely understanding the workings of the natural world, which is the goal of science. When the problem occurs, researchers and huge companies start solving the problem by introducing some new technology to ease the lifestyle of human beings as well as other living beings. Technology is a hands-on, can-do profession where people have to be skilled in many of the following: engineering, communicating, designing, developing, innovating, managing, manufacturing, modelling, and systems thinking. But generation additionally offers us numerous merchandise which may be used for true or sick or in which the advantages are disputed and further the strategies concerned in generating and the usage of generation approach that we ought to all take a hobby in whether or not it presents us and everyone else with a sustainable future.</p>

						<h3>Positive Impact Of Technology</h3>
						<p>Almost everyone is using technology for their work as well as for research. With the help of technology, each person can access information anytime and anywhere. A various field like education, internet, industries, and hospital uses technology for better output in their respective field. In education, teachers can use technology like the animated diagram and give the example of that certain course content to the student which makes student easy to learn rather than writing theoretically. Even students have a lot of sources to understand their assignment. Everything that the person wants to learn is possible with the help of technology. It also assists the student in decision-making with good presentation skills using PowerPoint. Research is regarded as an integral part of education where students can research from articles, books documents, and other reading materials. Therefore, with the help of the internet and storing facilities of technology, it makes it easy to research systematic way.</p>
						<p>We can feel climate change and it is in an increasing phase. Different researchers have developed technology-based weather monitoring system which has monitors temperature, air pressure, humidity, and light intensity. The tsunami that will happen near shore or rainfall occurring in any place can be estimated before it happens which can save many living being's life. Wireless Sensor Network is one technology that is embedded to identify the condition of any objects which can send the radio signal of suitable amplitude and message to know the situation of the objects. It identifies the situation of traffic jam in each road and by analyzing the road condition, people can take a different route where traffic jam is less.</p>

						<h3>Negative Impact Of Technology</h3>
						<p>Technology has a significant role in everyone's life that simplifies the way of living but that has affected the surrounding environments. to protect people suffering from various diseases. Although, it has performed various tasks to solve the problem of people and the environment. The technology is being used for destroying cities that may kill each other. For example the recent war between Palestine and Israel where rockets and airstrike are performed with the loss of heavy casualties. The space mission where the rocket fails to land on Mars or the moon may be dangerous. Recently, the china rocket mission failed to initialize their space station and was unknown where it would land on earth surface which is dangerous because if it lands in cities area, it may cause heavy damage to people and their infrastructure.</p>
						<p>From an internet perspective, the data are not secure due to which criminals may use our identity to perform crimes. The criminal uses crypto-currency to perform their transaction where it is difficult to track the location. In the dark web girls trafficking, drugs and weapons dealing is performed which is one of the technology develop by people. Technology has changed the interaction of communication. Studies have suggested that the lack of real-life contact is causing depression and other forms of mental illness in many people. Every task is performed by technological equipment which has caused the loss of people's employment.</p>

						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<p>The invention of new technology is the process cycle that will continue furthermore. Every technology has its negative and positive sides. So while developing the system, the researchers should analyze the long-term effect of that particular system before itâ€™s too late. Rather than developing weapons using technology, we can focus to minimize the increment of climate change and proper management of waste around the world. Personally, it would be better if researchers do more research to transfer our mind into a computer, not all at once but gradually with electrodes inserted into the brain and then wirelessly outsourcing faculties. Rerouting vision through cameras and storing memories on a net of microprocessors. For now, practically it is not possible but it would be better to take some steps.</p>
