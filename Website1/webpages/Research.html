						<p>While writing curriculum vitae(CV) in a coursework project, this website assists me to present my CV in a user-friendly way. This website has many templates of CV and I took which was useful to me. The round dots/circle were eye-catching so I start looking at how to create it and then implemented in the coursework project.</p>

In round dots/circle of coursework website, the black denotes the skill level it has and white is denoted when it has no skills.</p>

						<p>One year ago, I was just curious about aliens and started learning about them on websites to know their existence. One of those websites has a very fascinating design in the banner which was bookmarked in my Google Chrome and now it is implemented in our coursework project.</p>

						<p>The reference website has a different style in the text but the implementation is the same. Our website has a simple color style in comparison to references website because simple style looks suitable in my website with text in the center and larger font-size.</p>

						<p>It was always interesting to know mysterious activities happening in the world. So I started digging more about the dark web where criminal activities are more active. This reference website also has some basic information about the dark web and I found the logo and inner parts of the website attractive which was implemented in our project. </p>

						<p>Mostly, companies use the logo to denote their brands and put that logo on the website too. As I do not own any company for now so my website logo is completed with the flag of our country NEPAL.</p>
